# Project README

Welcome to my project! This README provides you with information on how to get started, general comments about the project, and possible improvements for future development.

## Get Started

To begin working with this project, follow these steps:

- **Start the Development Environment:**
  `npm run dev`

- **Run Tests:**
  `npm run test`

- **Check Test Coverage:**
  `npm run test:coverage`

## General Comments

Thank you for taking the time to review this project. I aimed to create a versatile form component capable of rendering various types of forms when provided with different field data. Notably, the form submission triggers via an `onClick` method on the button, which was based on my interpretation of the project instructions. Most of the styled components are in separate JavaScript files, which enhances code clarity. For the sake of time, the test files are also in JavaScript, as this project won't be deployed to production. It was an engaging take-home project, and I'm pleased to have completed it.

## Possible Improvements

In a real production scenario, and with more time, here are some potential enhancements that could be implemented:

- **Use TypeScript for all test files:** Migrate test files to TypeScript for stronger type checking.

- **Migrate to SWC from Babel:** Migrate from Babel to SWC to take full advantage of the next/font package.

- **Implement native form submission:** Use the native `onSubmit` functionality for the form instead of relying on `onClick` for the submission button.

- **Modularize validation function:** Export the validation function into its own component for reusability and maintainability.

- **Create a global style file:** Establish a global style file using styled-components to maintain consistent styling throughout the project.

- **Use a Confirmation Component:** Replace the form component with a confirmation component upon successful form submission instead of redirecting to a new page.

- **Retrieve Data from an API:** Fetch form field data from an API rather than using a text file, allowing for dynamic content.

- **Add a favicon:** Enhance the user experience by incorporating a nifty favicon for the project.

These improvements will contribute to a more robust and polished project if it were to be developed further.
